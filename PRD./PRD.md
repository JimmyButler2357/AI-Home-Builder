## 1. Vision & Philosophy

### The Central Idea

Software that generates architectural designs by **calculating wholeness** — implementing Christopher Alexander's design philosophy computationally. Each design decision emerges from the previous one in a sequential unfolding process, guided by mathematical measures of "life" in architecture.

### Three-Layer Architecture (Philosophical)

| Layer | Role | Mechanism |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **AI Agent** | Proposes design variations | LLM issues atomic building commands, interprets user intent |
| **Mathematical Scoring** | Evaluates wholeness | Salingaros formulas + Alexander's 15 properties, no learned weights |
| **Human Selection** | Makes final judgment | Mirror of the Self test — the user chooses what feels most alive |

The AI doesn't decide what's good. The math doesn't decide what's good. The **human** decides — informed by transparent, calculable measures of architectural life.

### How This Differs from Everything Else

| Approach | How It Works | Problem |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| AI design tools (Maket, Finch) | Learn from training data what buildings look like | Black box, statistical, no theory of quality |
| Evolutionary (homemaker-addon) | Generate population, select by fitness | Destroys wholeness through random generation |
| Parametric (Grasshopper) | Rule-based generation | Requires expert users, no built-in quality metrics |
| **This product** | AI proposes, math scores, human selects | Sequential unfolding with transparent wholeness scoring |

### Alexander's Sequential Unfolding (Core Process)

- Start with ONE seed state (site + constraints)
- Apply patterns in sequence — each addresses forces created by previous decisions
- Path-dependent: the order matters, each step constrains future possibilities
- Single trajectory through design space
- Human participates at each decision point
- Wholeness is preserved and strengthened throughout

This is the opposite of evolutionary search: **build UP from one seed through sequential differentiation**, don't filter DOWN from many candidates through selection pressure.

## 2. Product Overview

### What It Is

A web-based architectural design tool where users design single-family homes through a guided, step-by-step unfolding process. At each step, the system proposes design options (generated by AI), scores them mathematically for wholeness (Salingaros formulas), and presents ranked 3D-rendered options for the user to choose from.

### What It Is Not

- Not an AI that designs buildings for you (human is always the decision maker)
- Not a parametric tool requiring scripting/programming knowledge
- Not a black-box generator where you press a button and get a building
- Not a CAD replacement for detailed construction documentation (at least not initially)

### Core Experience (One Sentence)

A guided wizard walks you through designing a home step by step, showing you 3D-rendered options ranked by how much "architectural life" they create, and explaining why.

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary: Self-Builders

People designing their own homes who lack formal architectural training but care deeply about the quality of their living environment.

- **Need:** Guidance through complex design decisions without requiring expertise
- **Pain:** Current tools are either too simple (room planners) or too complex (CAD software)
- **Value prop:** "Design a home that feels alive, guided by the same principles behind the world's most beloved buildings"

### Primary: Architects

Practicing architects who are familiar with or sympathetic to Alexander's work.

- **Need:** A tool that supports quality-driven design process, not just productivity
- **Pain:** Existing tools optimize for speed/efficiency, not for the experiential quality of the result
- **Value prop:** "Quantify and improve the wholeness of your designs with transparent, explainable scoring"

### Secondary: Architecture Students

Students learning about design quality, spatial relationships, and architectural theory.

- **Need:** Interactive tools for understanding what makes good architecture
- **Value prop:** Educational — see how design decisions affect measurable qualities

## 5. Phase 1: Wholeness Analyzer

### Purpose

Upload or input a floor plan, receive wholeness scores broken down by Alexander's 15 properties, with explanations and improvement suggestions. Serves as both a standalone product and a validation tool for the scoring engine.

### MVP Feature Set

#### 5.1 Floor Plan Input

**V1: Structured manual input**
- Form-based: enter room names, approximate dimensions, adjacency relationships
- System generates a simple 2D plan representation from the structured data
- Low technical risk, fast to build

**V2: Image upload + AI extraction**
- Upload a photo, scan, or screenshot of a floor plan
- AI vision model extracts rooms, walls, openings, dimensions
- Convert to internal semantic representation for scoring

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How accurate does the AI extraction need to be for the scores to be meaningful? If a wall is off by 1 foot, does it change the Levels of Scale score? Need to test sensitivity.

#### 5.2 Wholeness Scoring Engine

**Core computation:** Salingaros formulas applied to the extracted geometry.

**V1 properties (implement first):**

| Property | Why First | 2D Feasibility |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Levels of Scale | Clearly defined: power-law distribution of element sizes | High |
| Strong Centers | Identifiable: local symmetry points, field from surrounding elements | High |
| Positive Space | Standard figure-ground analysis, convexity measures | High |
| Good Shape | Compactness ratios, recursive decomposability | High |
| Boundaries | Boundary thickness, gradation, transition zones | High |

**V2 properties (add incrementally):**

| Property | Challenge | 2D Feasibility |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Alternating Repetition | Pattern detection in element sequences | Medium |
| Local Symmetries | Multi-scale symmetry detection | Medium |
| Deep Interlock | Shared boundaries, hooking between spaces | Medium |
| Contrast | Difference measures between adjacent regions | Medium |
| Gradients | Smooth transitions in size, density | Medium |
| Echoes | Similarity across non-adjacent elements | Medium |

**V3 / Deferred properties:**

| Property | Challenge | 2D Feasibility |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Roughness | Fractal dimension, deviation from regularity | Low — needs detail data |
| The Void | Calm spaces amidst complexity | Medium — subjective threshold |
| Simplicity / Inner Calm | Entropy measures, information density | Low — definitional ambiguity |
| Not-Separateness | Continuity with context | Low — requires site/context data |

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Which properties can be meaningfully computed on a 2D floor plan vs. requiring 3D or site context? Need research + Salingaros consultation.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How to weight the 15 properties in the aggregate score? Equal weight? Theoretically derived? User-configurable?

#### 5.3 Results Display

- **Overall wholeness score** (L = T x H, scale 0-100)
- **Per-property breakdown** with visual indicators (bar chart or radar chart)
- **One-line explanations** for each property score: "Strong Centers: 7.2/10 — Your living room creates a well-defined center, but the entry sequence lacks focal points"
- **Expandable detail** for each property: what it means, why it matters, how it was calculated

#### 5.4 AI-Generated Suggestions

- For each low-scoring property, generate 2-3 specific, actionable improvement suggestions
- Example: "To improve Boundaries (currently 4.1/10): Consider adding a transition space between the public entry and private living areas. A covered porch or entry alcove would create a thicker boundary between outside and inside."
- Powered by LLM interpreting the scores + the floor plan context

#### 5.5 Heatmap Overlay (Deferred to V2)

- Compute wholeness at a grid of sample points across the plan
- Visualize as color overlay showing which areas contribute positively vs. negatively
- Computationally expensive — defer until scoring engine is optimized

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** What resolution is needed for a useful heatmap? Every 6 inches? Every foot? What's the computational cost at each resolution?

### Tech Stack (Phase 1)

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | Next.js (React) | App shell, input forms, results display |
| 2D Plan Rendering | HTML Canvas or SVG | Simple 2D visualization of the plan |
| Backend | Python (FastAPI) | Scoring engine, AI suggestion generation |
| AI Vision | Claude API (vision) | Image-to-plan extraction (V2) |
| AI Suggestions | Claude API (text) | Improvement suggestions |
| Storage | localStorage | Auto-save, no auth needed |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Fly (Python) | Simple deployment |

### Success Metrics (Phase 1)

- Scoring engine produces meaningful spread (>20 point range) across known good vs. bad buildings
- At least 5 of the 15 properties can be computed from 2D floor plans
- 100 users from Alexander community provide feedback
- Scores correlate directionally with expert judgment on test cases

## 6. Phase 2: Command Agent Prototype

### Purpose

Validate that an LLM agent can generate architecturally coherent building designs by issuing sequential atomic commands, with per-step geometric validation. This is a **research prototype**, not a product.

### Command Vocabulary (V1 — Minimal)

```
Site Commands:
  set_boundary(polygon)        — Define site boundary
  set_setback(side, distance)  — Define building setbacks
  set_orientation(degrees)     — True north

Building Commands:
  place_wall(start, end, height, thickness)
  create_opening(wall_id, type[door|window], position, width, height)
  define_room(name, boundary_walls[])
  set_floor_level(level, height)
  place_roof(type[gable|hip|flat|shed], boundary, pitch)

Modification Commands:
  move_wall(wall_id, offset)
  resize_opening(opening_id, new_width, new_height)
  extend_wall(wall_id, new_endpoint)
  subdivide_room(room_id, wall_placement)
```

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Is this command vocabulary expressive enough? What commands are missing for basic residential design? Need to prototype and discover gaps.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Should commands operate on absolute coordinates or relative to existing elements? Relative commands ("place wall 3m from east wall of kitchen") may be more natural for the LLM.

### Validity Checker

Rules applied after each command:

**Geometric validity (V1):**
- No wall-wall intersections (except at endpoints)
- Rooms form closed polygons
- Minimum room dimensions (configurable, default: 6' x 6')
- Openings fit within wall dimensions
- Floor areas are positive and reasonable

**Circulation validity (V1):**
- All rooms reachable from an entry point
- Doors create connected graph of rooms
- No rooms accessible only through other bedrooms/bathrooms

**Deferred validity:**
- Structural feasibility (span limits, load paths)
- Building code compliance (egress, accessibility)
- MEP feasibility (plumbing stack proximity, etc.)

### Test Protocol

1. Define 10 residential design prompts ranging from simple to complex:
   - "A 1-bedroom studio apartment, 500 sq ft"
   - "A 3-bedroom family home with open plan living, 1800 sq ft"
   - "An L-shaped house around a courtyard, 2400 sq ft"
2. Run each prompt 5 times with Claude, collect generated command sequences
3. Measure: validity rate, architectural coherence (human judgment), variety across runs
4. Compare wholeness scores of generated designs against hand-designed equivalents

### Success Metrics (Phase 2)

- >70% of generated command sequences produce geometrically valid plans
- >50% of valid plans are architecturally coherent (judged by human review)
- Generated designs show meaningful variety (not the same plan every time)
- The LLM can interpret natural language intent ("cozy reading nook") into appropriate commands

## 7. Phase 3: 3D Viewer

### Purpose

Build the rendering layer that converts semantic JSON building models into navigable 3D scenes in the browser. This is an **independent component** that can be developed in parallel with Phases 1-2.

### Semantic Model → 3D Geometry Pipeline

```
Semantic JSON                    Three.js Scene
─────────────                    ──────────────
{type: "wall",                   → BoxGeometry(length, height, thickness)
 start: [0,0],                     positioned and rotated in 3D space
 end: [5,0],
 height: 3,
 thickness: 0.15}

{type: "opening",                → Subtract from wall geometry (CSG)
 wall: "wall_1",                   Add door/window mesh
 kind: "door",
 position: 1.2,
 width: 0.9,
 height: 2.1}

{type: "roof",                   → Custom geometry based on type
 kind: "gable",                    (gable, hip, shed, flat)
 boundary: [...],
 pitch: 35}
```

### Progressive Rendering Fidelity

| Level | Visual Quality | When Used |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Block** | Extruded volumes, flat colors, no detail | Quick option comparison (5 cards) |
| **Architectural** | Basic materials, shadows, ambient occlusion | Evaluating selected option |
| **Detailed** | Textures, vegetation, context | Final design review |

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Can Three.js handle rendering 3-5 block-level models simultaneously (for the option cards) at interactive frame rates? Need to prototype and benchmark.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Should detailed rendering use a different pipeline (e.g., server-side rendering with a path tracer) for quality, or keep everything client-side?

### Camera Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Controls |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Orbital** | Overall form evaluation, spatial relationships | Click-drag rotate, scroll zoom |
| **First Person** | Experience the space as occupant (Mirror of Self test) | WASD movement, mouse look |
| **Section Cut** | Reveal interior spatial relationships | Drag plane to slice through model |

### Tech Choices

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Three.js** | Most popular, largest community, most tutorials/AI training data | Lower-level, more boilerplate |
| **React Three Fiber** | React integration, declarative scene graph | Abstraction layer adds complexity |
| **Babylon.js** | More built-in features, better inspector/debugging | Smaller community |
| **IFC.js / web-ifc** | Built for architectural models, handles BIM data | May be overkill for this use case |

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Which 3D library to use? Recommendation: **React Three Fiber** (R3F) — it integrates naturally with Next.js, has a large ecosystem of helpers (@react-three/drei), and the declarative API is more approachable for someone learning 3D.

### Success Metrics (Phase 3)

- Can render a complete single-family home from semantic JSON at 60fps (block level)
- Orbital, first-person, and section cut cameras all functional
- Can render 3-5 block-level models simultaneously for option comparison
- Semantic model changes reflect in 3D within 100ms

---

## 8. Phase 4: Full Product — Wholeness Design Tool

### Purpose

Integrate Phases 1-3 into the complete vision: a guided, step-by-step architectural design tool with wholeness scoring, AI-generated options, and 3D visualization.

### The Unfolding Sequence

Following Alexander's scale sequence from *The Nature of Order*:

| Step | Scale | Decisions | Example |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Site** | Boundary, access points, orientation, views | "Entry from north, garden faces south-west" |
| 2 | **Building Mass** | Overall footprint shape, stories, major volumes | "L-shape, two stories, wrapping the garden" |
| 3 | **Wings & Zones** | Public vs. private, indoor vs. outdoor, service | "Living wing faces garden, bedrooms upstairs" |
| 4 | **Rooms** | Individual room sizes, shapes, relationships | "Kitchen opens to dining, 4m x 5m" |
| 5 | **Circulation** | Halls, stairs, thresholds, transitions | "Central stair, entry alcove creates transition" |
| 6 | **Openings** | Windows, doors, skylights, their sizes and positions | "South-facing window wall in living room" |
| 7 | **Details** | Built-in features, niches, shelves, seat walls | "Window seat in reading nook, fireplace niche" |

Each scale level contains multiple individual steps. The user controls how many steps to manually decide vs. auto-resolve at each scale.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** What is the right default number of manual steps per scale? Too many = tedious. Too few = the system decides too much. Need user testing.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How does the system determine the sequence within each scale level? Is it fixed (Alexander prescribed an order) or dynamic (based on current field state)?

### The Step UI (Card-Based)

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Clicking a card expands it to a full 3D view with orbital, first-person, and section views. Click "Select" to commit and proceed.

### Guided Wizard: First-Time User Flow

The wizard collects initial information before the unfolding begins:

1. **"Tell me about your household"** — Family size, ages, lifestyle, pets, work-from-home
2. **"Describe your site"** — Draw/upload boundary, mark street access, indicate north, note views and neighbors
3. **"What matters most to you?"** — Prioritize: natural light, privacy, connection to outdoors, entertaining, quiet spaces
4. **"Any specific rooms or features?"** — Must-haves, nice-to-haves, total size budget
5. **"Show me buildings you love"** — Optional: upload photos, system analyzes which properties are prominent (learns preference weights)

From this input, the system determines:
- Pattern sequence and priorities
- Site constraints and boundary conditions
- The starting "seed state" for unfolding

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How much initial information is enough? Too little → poor early options. Too much → overwhelming before you even start. Need UX testing.

### Free Chat Integration

Between or during steps, users can type natural language:

- **"Make the kitchen bigger"** → System evaluates scope: structural change → creates branch point, re-unfolds from room layout step
- **"Add a window here"** → System evaluates scope: local change → adjusts in-place, re-scores
- **"What if the house faced the other way?"** → System evaluates scope: fundamental change → creates branch from site orientation step
- **"Why did option A score higher?"** → System explains the wholeness difference

The LLM interprets intent, classifies the scope of change, and either modifies in-place or creates a branch.

### Branch & Undo System

```
Step 1 ── Step 2 ── Step 3 ── Step 4 ── Step 5 (current)
                        │
                        └── Step 3b ── Step 4b (branch: "bigger kitchen")
```

- **Linear undo:** Step backward through the main sequence
- **Branch:** Fork from any past step, creating a parallel design path
- **Compare:** View two branches side-by-side (split-screen 3D)
- **Merge:** Not supported (too complex) — pick one branch to continue

Branches are labeled by the user or auto-labeled by the change that created them.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How do you present branches to non-technical users? A git-style tree graph will confuse self-builders. Need a simpler metaphor — maybe "alternate designs" or "what if" explorations.

### Output: Architectural Drawings

From the committed semantic model, auto-generate:

- **Floor plans** — 2D plan view with room labels, dimensions, door swings
- **Elevations** — Front, back, sides
- **Sections** — At least one longitudinal, one cross section
- **Site plan** — Building footprint on site with setbacks and access

Format: SVG for web display, PDF for download/print.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** What level of drawing quality is acceptable? Schematic design level (bubble diagrams → rough plans) or design development level (dimensioned, detailed plans)? The latter is significantly more work.

## 9. Spinoff: Zillow/Redfin Wholeness Scorer

### Concept

Score real estate listings on architectural wholeness. Paste a listing URL → system pulls the floor plan → scores it → explains strengths and weaknesses.

### Why Build This

- **Viral potential:** "My house scored 73/100 on architectural wholeness" is shareable
- **Market validation:** Do consumers care about wholeness scores? This tests it at scale
- **Audience building:** Every user becomes aware of wholeness-based design quality
- **Shared engine:** Same scoring backend as the Wholeness Analyzer

### Implementation

- Browser extension (Chrome/Firefox) that adds a wholeness score badge to listing pages
- Or standalone web app: paste URL, get analysis
- Uses the same floor plan extraction + scoring engine as the Analyzer
- Adds comparative context: "This home scores higher than 68% of listings in this area"

### Challenges

- Floor plan availability varies by listing (many don't include floor plans)
- Floor plan quality varies widely (hand-drawn vs. professional vs. marketing renders)
- Legal considerations around scraping listing data

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Do Zillow/Redfin provide floor plan data through their APIs? Or does this require scraping?

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Could this partner with a listing platform rather than scrape? A "Wholeness Score" badge on listings could benefit both parties.

### Request Flow (One Unfolding Step)

```
1. Frontend sends:
   - Current semantic model (JSON)
   - Current step context (which scale, which decision)
   - User preferences / prior selections

2. LLM Agent Orchestrator:
   - Constructs prompt with model state + pattern context
   - LLM generates 5-8 variations as command sequences
   - Each command is validated in real-time by Validity Checker
   - Invalid commands are rejected; LLM retries or moves on

3. Wholeness Scorer:
   - Receives 5-8 valid semantic model variants
   - Computes 15 properties for each
   - Computes aggregate L score (T × H)
   - Generates one-line explanation per variant

4. Backend returns:
   - Top 3-5 variants (JSON diffs from current model)
   - Scores and explanations
   - Estimated time: 3-10 seconds

5. Frontend:
   - Applies each JSON diff to create variant models
   - Renders each as a 3D block model in a card
   - User selects one → commit → auto-save → next step
```

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** How to represent curved walls, stairs, and multi-height spaces in this schema?

### API Cost Estimate

| Component | Tokens/Step | Steps/House | Total | Cost (est.) |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| LLM variation generation | ~2,000/variation × 6 variations | 50 | 600,000 | ~$2-4 |
| Explanation generation | ~200/explanation × 4 options | 50 | 40,000 | ~$0.15 |
| Free chat interactions | ~500/interaction | 20 (est.) | 10,000 | ~$0.04 |
| **Total per house design** | | | **~650,000** | **~$2-5** |

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Is $2-5 per design session sustainable? Can it be passed to users via subscription? Need pricing model analysis.

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Can smaller/local models handle the command generation to reduce costs? The commands are structured and constrained — a fine-tuned smaller model might work.

## 11. Scoring Engine

### Salingaros Core Variables

| Variable | Name | Formula | Range |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| T | Temperature | Degree of detail, curvature, color | 0-10 |
| H | Harmony | Degree of coherence, internal symmetry | 0-10 |
| L | Life | T × H | 0-100 |
| C | Complexity | T × (10 - H) | 0-100 |

High L = high life (the goal). High T with low H = complexity without coherence (chaos). Low T with high H = boring order.

### The 15 Properties: Computational Approaches

Below are initial ideas for how each property could be computed. These are starting points for research, not final implementations.

#### 1. Levels of Scale
**Concept:** Elements should exist at many different sizes, following roughly a geometric progression (each level ~2-3× the next).
**Computation approach:**
- Collect all element sizes (room areas, wall lengths, opening sizes)
- Histogram of sizes on log scale
- Score based on how well the distribution fits a power law
- Penalize gaps in the scale hierarchy

#### 2. Strong Centers
**Concept:** Every part of the design should have identifiable centers — points of focus that organize surrounding space.
**Computation approach:**
- For each room: compute centroid, measure symmetry around it
- Rate the "strength" of each center by how much surrounding geometry reinforces it
- Score based on the number and strength of centers at multiple scales

#### 3. Boundaries
**Concept:** Centers should be bounded by thick, structured boundaries — not thin lines but zones of transition.
**Computation approach:**
- Measure wall thickness relative to room size
- Detect transition zones (entry sequences, thresholds, porches)
- Score based on boundary thickness and internal structure

#### 4. Alternating Repetition
**Concept:** Repeated elements should alternate (ABABAB) rather than monotonously repeat (AAAAAA).
**Computation approach:**
- Detect repeating elements (windows, columns, room sequences)
- Analyze pattern: alternating vs. uniform repetition
- Score based on the presence and quality of alternation

#### 5. Positive Space
**Concept:** Every bit of space — both "figure" and "ground" — should be a positive, convex, well-shaped entity.
**Computation approach:**
- Figure-ground reversal: are the leftover spaces (corridors, voids) also well-shaped?
- Convexity measure for each space
- Score based on minimum convexity across all spaces (weakest link)

#### 6. Good Shape
**Concept:** Individual elements and spaces have shapes that are internally coherent and can be recursively decomposed into good sub-shapes.
**Computation approach:**
- Compactness ratio (area / perimeter²) for each room
- Aspect ratio assessment
- Recursive decomposability check

#### 7. Local Symmetries
**Concept:** Symmetry at many local scales (not necessarily global symmetry).
**Computation approach:**
- Detect symmetry axes for each room, each wall arrangement, each group of openings
- Count symmetries at each scale level
- Score based on density and distribution of local symmetries

#### 8. Deep Interlock and Ambiguity
**Concept:** Adjacent spaces should hook into each other, creating ambiguous shared zones.
**Computation approach:**
- Measure boundary complexity between adjacent spaces
- Detect interlocking geometries (L-shapes that mesh, alcoves that extend)
- Score based on boundary fractal dimension or roughness

#### 9. Contrast
**Concept:** Adjacent elements should have clear differences — avoiding mushy, ambiguous transitions.
**Computation approach:**
- Measure size ratios between adjacent rooms
- Detect light/dark contrasts (window density variation)
- Score based on the clarity of distinctions between zones

#### 10. Gradients
**Concept:** Smooth transitions in size, height, enclosure, from one condition to another.
**Computation approach:**
- Detect directional gradients in room sizes, ceiling heights, window density
- Score based on smoothness (low noise) and intentionality of gradients

#### 11. Roughness
**Concept:** Imperfection and irregularity — not machine-perfect but showing human-scale variation.
**Computation approach:**
- Measure deviation from perfect geometry (walls not quite parallel, rooms not quite rectangular)
- Fractal dimension of the overall plan
- Score: too perfect = low, too random = low, slight irregularity = high

> **[RESEARCH NEEDED]** This property is difficult to implement meaningfully at the generative stage, since the system produces geometry procedurally. May need to be addressed through deliberate imperfection injection.

#### 12. Echoes
**Concept:** Similar shapes, proportions, or angles recurring across the design at different scales or locations.
**Computation approach:**
- Detect similar angle families, proportion families, shape families
- Score based on the number of echoing relationships

#### 13. The Void
**Concept:** A calm, empty center amidst surrounding complexity.
**Computation approach:**
- Detect the largest empty/simple space
- Measure contrast between the void and its surroundings
- Score based on presence and quality of void spaces

#### 14. Simplicity and Inner Calm
**Concept:** Despite complexity, the overall composition should feel simple and calm.
**Computation approach:**
- Information entropy measure of the plan
- Element count relative to plan size
- Score based on achieving complexity without clutter

#### 15. Not-Separateness
**Concept:** The building should merge with its context, not stand as an isolated object.
**Computation approach:**
- Requires site context data
- Measure alignment with site geometry (edges, contours, vegetation)
- Boundary permeability (how many connections between inside and outside)

> **[RESEARCH NEEDED]** This property fundamentally requires context data that may not be available in early versions. May need to be deferred or approximated.

## 12. UX & Design Principles

### Visual Language

**Warm and natural aesthetic** reflecting Alexander's humanistic philosophy:
- Earth tone palette: warm grays, muted terracottas, soft greens, natural wood tones
- Organic UI elements: soft corners, natural shadows, tactile feel
- Typography: readable, warm serif or humanist sans-serif
- Generous whitespace, unhurried layout

### Key UX Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure:** Show wholeness scores as simple numbers by default. Full explanations available on click. Never overwhelm.
2. **Always oriented:** User always knows what step they're on, what's been decided, what's coming next. A persistent breadcrumb/progress indicator.
3. **Human is the hero:** The system proposes, explains, and scores — but the user's choice is always respected, even when it reduces wholeness.
4. **Tactile 3D:** The 3D experience should feel like manipulating a physical model. Smooth camera, satisfying interactions, responsive rendering.
5. **No jargon for self-builders:** "This layout creates a clear center in your living area" not "Strong Centers property score improved by 2.3."

### Information Density by Mode

| Mode | Score Display | Explanation | 3D Detail |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Learning** | Full breakdown, all 15 properties | Always visible, rich text | Progressive |
| **Standard** | Overall score + top 3 factors | One-line, expand on click | Block → architectural |
| **Expert** | Raw scores, weights, deltas from previous step | Technical, property-level | User controlled |

Default for self-builders: Standard. Default for architects: Expert.

### Accessibility Considerations

- Color-blind safe scoring indicators (not just red/green)
- Keyboard navigation for wizard steps
- Screen reader support for scoring explanations
- Mobile: view-only (design on desktop, review on phone)

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Is mobile design feasible or only mobile viewing? 3D manipulation on touch screens is possible but different.

---

## 13. Business & Monetization

### Phase 1: Build Audience (Free)

- Wholeness Analyzer: free tier (3 analyses/month), paid tier ($9/month unlimited)
- Pattern Explorer content: free (drives traffic and brand awareness)
- Goal: 1,000 active users from Alexander/architecture community

### Phase 2: Design Tool (Subscription)

- Free: explore the tool, complete 1 design (watermarked output)
- Pro: $29/month — unlimited designs, full drawing output, branching, preference learning
- Studio: $99/month — team features (future), API access, priority rendering

### Phase 3: Premium Features

- VR walkthrough export
- Integration with CAD tools (Revit/ArchiCAD export)
- Contractor-ready documentation
- Custom pattern libraries

### Revenue Model Considerations

- API costs ($2-5/session) must be covered by subscription
- At $29/month, a user doing 5 designs/month costs $10-25 in API — thin margins
- At $29/month with typical usage (1-2 designs/month), margins are healthy
- Power users may need usage caps or tiered pricing

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** Should there be a per-design fee instead of subscription? "Pay $15 per house design" might align better with self-builder usage patterns (design once, not monthly).

> **[OPEN QUESTION]** What's the willingness-to-pay for this in the self-builder market? Architecture students? Need customer development interviews.

## 15. Research Areas

### Must Research Before Building

#### R1: Computational Formalization of the 15 Properties
- **What:** Translate Alexander/Salingaros conceptual descriptions into executable functions
- **Why:** This IS the product. Everything depends on scores being meaningful.
- **How:** Review Salingaros's published formulas in detail. Consult with Salingaros directly. Review any existing computational implementations (academic papers, thesis projects). Implement 4-5 properties and test on known buildings.
- **Key papers:**
  - Salingaros, "Life and Complexity in Architecture from a Thermodynamic Analogy" (1997)
  - Salingaros, "Connecting the Fractal City" (2003)
  - Any thesis/dissertation work on computational pattern language

#### R2: LLM Spatial Reasoning via Atomic Commands
- **What:** Test whether current LLMs can reliably generate valid building command sequences
- **Why:** Determines whether the AI agent layer is feasible
- **How:** Design 10 test prompts, run each 5× with Claude, measure validity and coherence rates. Test with and without few-shot examples of valid command sequences.
- **Key variable:** What prompt engineering techniques improve spatial coherence?

#### R3: Floor Plan Image Extraction Accuracy
- **What:** How accurately can vision AI extract room boundaries, walls, and openings from floor plan images?
- **Why:** Required for the Wholeness Analyzer's image upload feature
- **How:** Collect 50 floor plan images of varying quality. Run through Claude vision / GPT-4V. Measure extraction accuracy against ground truth.
- **Key variable:** What image quality threshold is needed for reliable extraction?

#### R4: Alexander Pattern Language IP Status
- **What:** Legal status of the 253 patterns for commercial use
- **Why:** Using pattern names, numbers, or descriptions in a commercial product may have IP implications
- **How:** Consult IP attorney. Research existing commercial uses of pattern language. Contact the Center for Environmental Structure or Alexander's estate.
- **Alternatives if restricted:** Use Salingaros's framework, write original pattern descriptions, focus on the 15 properties rather than the 253 patterns.

### Should Research During Building

#### R5: Score Sensitivity Analysis
- **What:** How sensitive are wholeness scores to small geometric changes?
- **Why:** If moving a wall 6 inches changes the score by 20 points, the scores are too noisy. If moving a wall 6 feet doesn't change the score, they're too insensitive.
- **How:** Implement scoring on a test plan. Systematically vary parameters. Plot score vs. change magnitude.

#### R6: Cross-Cultural Validity
- **What:** Do wholeness scores apply equally across architectural traditions? Alexander claimed universality.
- **Why:** If targeting global market, scores must work for Japanese houses, Mediterranean villas, and Scandinavian cabins.
- **How:** Score exemplary buildings from diverse traditions. Look for systematic biases.

#### R7: Existing Computational Implementations
- **What:** Has anyone else implemented the 15 properties computationally?
- **Why:** Avoid reinventing the wheel; learn from prior attempts.
- **How:** Literature review, GitHub search, academic database search.
- **Known prior work:** Bruno Postle's homemaker-addon (evolutionary approach, not direct property calculation), various academic papers.

#### R8: 3D Web Rendering Performance
- **What:** What level of geometric complexity can Three.js / R3F handle at 60fps for this use case?
- **Why:** Determines rendering strategy and quality targets
- **How:** Build benchmark scenes with varying polygon counts, multiple simultaneous views. Test on mid-range hardware.

### Could Research Eventually

#### R9: VR Integration Approaches
- **What:** How to add VR walkthrough capability to a Three.js-based web app
- **Why:** Future feature for immersive evaluation
- **How:** WebXR API, A-Frame integration, Quest browser support

#### R10: Structural Feasibility Approximation
- **What:** Simple heuristics for structural plausibility (span limits, load-bearing wall placement)
- **Why:** Validity checking beyond geometric overlap
- **How:** Consult structural engineering rules of thumb. Encode as simple constraints.

#### R11: Building Code Databases
- **What:** Machine-readable building code data (room sizes, egress, accessibility)
- **Why:** Future validity checking layer
- **How:** Research ICC code databases, local jurisdiction variations, existing compliance-checking tools.

## 16. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Scoring formulas don't discriminate meaningfully | Critical | Medium | Test early on known buildings. Pivot to different formulas if needed. |
| LLM can't generate coherent building commands | High | Medium | Prototype early. Fall back to constrained parametric generation if needed. |
| Scope creep prevents shipping anything | High | High | Ship the Wholeness Analyzer as a standalone product first. Each phase is independently useful. |
| IP issues with Alexander's pattern language | Medium | Unknown | Research early. Prepare alternative framing (Salingaros-based, original descriptions). |
| 3D rendering too complex for hobby developer | Medium | Medium | Use React Three Fiber + drei helpers. Extensive AI-assisted development. Start with block models only. |
| API costs make the product unprofitable | Medium | Low | Optimize prompts, cache results, consider local models for simpler tasks. |
| No market demand | Medium | Low-Medium | Community connections enable early validation. Analyzer provides early signal. |
| User fatigue over 50+ step process | Medium | Medium | Make steps skippable (auto-resolve). Test and tune step count. |
